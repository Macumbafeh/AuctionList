# AuctionList

###### Scary warning: Most of these addons were made long ago during Feenix days, then a lot was changed/added to prepare for Corecraft. Since it died, they still haven't been extensively tested on modern servers.

## Purpose:
This lets you create a simple list of items to search for one at a time at the auction house using forward/back buttons. If you use Auctioneer and have it set to buy things at certain prices, you can answer those popups without moving away from the forward/back buttons.

## Using:
You can edit the list any time by using: **`/auctionlist`**

Each button has multiple things it can do based on the type of click. The question mark icon on the shopping list will show a tooltip for a reminder.
